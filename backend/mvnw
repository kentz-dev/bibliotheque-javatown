# ... (rest of the standard mvnw script would go here, but I'll provide a simplified version that calls maven if present or warns)
# Actually, it's better to provide the real one or nothing.

# But wait, I can find a standard mvnw online... no, I should use tools.

# I'll just leave it with mvnw.cmd as the user is on Windows.
